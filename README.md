# OOP-Coursework
Final Project Code for MPCS 51050

This project is written in Java and uses Apache Camel to send messages through a stock trade lifecycle.

It is a bit tedious to explain how to run this program for someone who wouldn't already know what they are doing.

Please refer to the screenshot if you don't know what you're doing to get a feel for how the program will look once the project is running.
